HTML HEADINGS : Titles or subtitles you wish to display on a webpage.


<h1 to h6> </h1 to /h6>

Important to use to show doc structure. 

#Use HTML HEADINGS for headings only and not to make them BIG or BOLD.

They each have a default size, modified with the STYLE attribute, using CSS font-size property. eg:<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>


HTML PARAPGRAPHS : defined by <p> html element and always starts on a new line.

With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code/.In browsers how your html code is displayed  is automatic.

HTML HORIZONTAL RULES : 
<hr> tag defines a  thematic break in HTML page, often displayed as a horizontal rule/line. It is used to separate content/define a change in an HTML page. It is a an empty tag

HTML LINE BREAKS:
<br> defines a line break(a new line without starting a new paragraph). Also an empty tag as I stated in my earlier notes.
eg:<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

OR

HTML <pre> ELEMENT:
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
eg: 
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>

AND NOT

<p>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</p>
because even though the text is preformatted, when we will run the code it wil display in one continuous line.
