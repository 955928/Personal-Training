HTML COMMENT TAGS:

<!-- Write your comments here --> 

Can be used to hide content 
eg:<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->

<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

#Everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display.
eg: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!--
<p>Look at this cool image:</p>
<img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
-->
<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

Comments are also good for debugging HTML because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors. 

HIDE INLINE CONTENT : Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code. eg:<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>
