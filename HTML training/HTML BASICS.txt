<!DOCTYPE html> all html must start with this tag: allows browers to open webpages  properly
#not case sensitive.

PS: when constructing an HTML element, it often has a start and end tag (<x> </x>), except for the <!DOCTYPE>. Those that may have a start tag like <br> but no end tags are called EMPTY ELEMENTS.

<html> starts document(root element). </html> ends document

<body>/ </body>: what shows the elements on the webpage. Visual parts of doc are between them.

HTML HEADINGS: Start with <h1> to <h6> (the latter being the least important heading) tags and ends with </h1> to </h6> respectively.

<p> </p>: HTML Paragraphs tag

<a> </a>: HTML Links tag  which is specified in the "href =" attribute which follows directly after the opening tag befor sepcifiying link in inverted commas. eg <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>


<img>: HTML Image tags
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes; Eg:

<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

NESTED HTML ELEMENTS: HTML ELEMENTS that contain other elements; All html elements contain these nested elements. Like in the fist index page that i created , they contain 4 (<html>,<body>,<h> and <p>)

<br>: an empty element that defines a line break. eg:
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

#The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.
