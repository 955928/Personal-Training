 HTML COLORS:

Color can be specified using color names.

Background Color : eg <h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>

Text color : eg <h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>

Border Color : eg<h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>

Color Values : In HTML, colors can also be specified using RGB values, HEX values, HSL values, RGBA values, and HSLA values.The following three <div> elements have their background color set with RGB, HEX, and HSL values respectively: 
                                     eg: rgb(255, 99, 71)
                                          #ff6347
                                          hsl(9, 100%, 64%)   
eg: <h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">...</h1>

RGB Color Values:
In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:

rgb(red, green, blue)

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.

This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!
For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0

Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 0.

To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).

To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).

Shades of Gray : often defined using equal values for all three parameters

RGBA Color Values : an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with:

rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
#The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)


HEX COLOR VALUES :
A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.


Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).

For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.

Another example, #00ff00 is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 00.

To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000.

To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff.

Shades of Gray : often defined using equal values for all three parameters:

HTML HSL AND HSLA COLORS : 

HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.

HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity).

In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.


Saturation : can be described as the intensity of a color.

100% is pure color, no shades of gray.

50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.

0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color.



Lightness : The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light), and 100% means full lightness (white).

Shades of Gray : often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjusting the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades:


HSLA Color Values : an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An HSLA color value is specified with:

hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):
